## Algorithms Implemented

- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort** 
- **Selection Sort**

## Languages

- **C++** - Using `std::async` and `std::future` for parallel execution
- **Julia** - Using `@threads` macro from `Base.Threads`
- **Python** - Using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`

## Project Structure

Serial versions of sorting algorithms were derived from GeeksforGeeks (or written by me for the Julia ones). Files with _parallel was generated from GPT-5 (some with some manual modifications), files with _parallel_new were generated by Cursor in Auto mode.


## Compilation and Execution

### C++
```bash
# Compile with threading support
g++ -std=c++17 -pthread -O2 <filename>.cpp -o <executable>

# Run
./<executable>
```

### Julia
```bash
# Run directly
julia <filename>.jl
```

### Python
```bash
# Run with Python 3
python3 <filename>.py
```
